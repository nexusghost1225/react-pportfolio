                I am a 22 year old male with a passion for music and computers. As I spent my days making music bot on stage and off stage, I spent alot of time on a computer. Even as a young boy I spent most of my freetime playing video games and takaing aprt old electronics with my dad.
                That eventually lead me to working in automotivefor a short time, but ultimately turned to the wonderful and exciting world of software development. I traded my wrenches for a keyboard and instead of diagnosing vehicles and replacing parts
                I now diagnose bugs in code and take imagination from a blank screen to a fully functional web application.
